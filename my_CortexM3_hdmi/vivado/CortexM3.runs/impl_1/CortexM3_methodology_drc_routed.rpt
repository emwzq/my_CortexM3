TIMING-27#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock u_custom_apb_hdmi/instance_name/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin u_custom_apb_hdmi/instance_name/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins

TIMING-30#1 Warning
Sub-optimal master source pin selection for generated clock  
The generated clock u_custom_apb_hdmi/u_img2hdmi/rgb2dvi_m0/U0/SerialClk has a sub-optimal master source pin selection, timing can be pessimistic
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-36#1 Warning
Invalid Generated Clock due to missing edge propagation  
There is no rising/falling edge propagation between master clock clk_out1_video_clk to generated clock u_custom_apb_hdmi/u_img2hdmi/rgb2dvi_m0/U0/SerialClk
Related violations: <none>

XDCB-5#1 Warning
Runtime inefficient way to find pin objects  
The option '-through : [get_pins -filter {NAME =~ *SyncAsync*/oSyncStages_reg[0]/D} -hier]' of constraint 'set_false_path' uses inefficient query to find pin objects (see constraint position '2' in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). To reduce runtime, it is recommended to get the pins through the cell objects. Please refer to Using Constraints Guide (Constraints Efficiency). An example of optimal query is: get_pins -filter {REF_PIN_NAME=~yy*} -of_objects [get_cells -hierarchical xx*].
